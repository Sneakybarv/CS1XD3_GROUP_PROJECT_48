            <h1>Initial Client Report</h1>
            
            <h2>Project Name</h2>
            <p><strong>Extremity Vault</strong></p>

            <h2>Client Information</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Client Name:</strong> Fahtyma Chalhoub<br>
                <strong>Organizational Affiliation:</strong> Independent Artist and Writer

        <section>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The client would like a web application that serves as a central archive and showcase for a
                long-term creative passion project. The application will function as both a portfolio and a
                structured knowledge base, allowing visitors to explore original writing, artwork, and
                worldbuilding content in an organized and accessible manner.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Target Users</h2>
            <p>
                The target users include readers, artists, and creative enthusiasts who are interested in
                original fictional worlds and storytelling. The application is intended primarily for
                desktop use, as users are expected to read longer text and view detailed artwork. However,
                a mobile-friendly format is also desired to ensure accessibility across devices.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Static Information</h2>
            <p>
                The web application should provide the following static information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The project name, <em>Extremity Vault</em></li>
                <li>The creator's name</li>
                <li>A link to the creator's art-focused Instagram page</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Design and Look & Feel</h2>
            <p>
                The client would like the web app to feel artistic, creative, and in tune with the fictional
                world being presented. At the same time, the design should remain minimalist and well
                organized so users are not overwhelmed. Clear navigation, intentional layouts, and a calm
                visual style are preferred, while excessive clutter or distracting elements should be
                avoided.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data to Be Managed or Presented</h2>
            <p>
                The application should manage and present:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wiki-style articles containing character information, worldbuilding details, and plot summaries</li>
                <li>An organized catalogue of original writing and artwork</li>
                <li>Interlinked content that allows users to move easily between related information</li>
                <li>User-submitted creative work, pending approval by administrators</li>
                <li>Optional user accounts for saving data and personal content</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Interactive and Media Elements</h2>
            <p>
                The web app should support embedded images and videos to showcase artwork and related media.
                It should also provide a comfortable reading experience for written content. While no
                complex interactive features are required initially, smooth navigation and content access
                are essential.
